An IoT wearable device based on machine learning, which detects epileptic seizures through various sensors as EDA and Accelerometer, then alerts the patients and their relative through a smartphone application, in order to take the necessary precautions.

In order to build that system, we used various technologies, methodologies, libraries, frameworks, and tools like:
1- Python; Scikit-Learn for the Machine Learning models.
2- JSON Server; for deploying the Machine Learning model on a local test server.
3- Fusion 360; for designing and 3D printing of device prototype.
4- Flutter; for designing the cross-platform smartphone application.
