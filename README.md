## Machine Learning-Based IoT Wearable Device for Epileptic Seizure Detection
An IoT wearable device based on machine learning, which detects epileptic seizures through various sensors as EDA and Accelerometer, then alerts the patients and their relative through a smartphone application to take the necessary precautions.

### 💻 To build that system, we used various technologies, methodologies, libraries, frameworks, and tools like:
* Python; Scikit-Learn for the Machine Learning models.
* JSON Server; for deploying the Machine Learning model on a local test server.
* Fusion 360; for designing and 3D printing of device prototype.
* Flutter; for designing the cross-platform smartphone application.
